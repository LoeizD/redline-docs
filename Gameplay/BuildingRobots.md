# Building robots

Robots are made of 8 parts. Each part is an NFT. The first Redline season will feature 295 types of parts, and many more visual customizations. An assembly of 8 parts that form a robot is called a build. Building is done through a web based drag and drop interface.

Robot parts give access to certain moves and have definite stats that interact with the race equation.

Robot builds and moves must be submitted at a fixed time before the race, and every setup is public. The first to submit their robots get a bonus in the race, but others are able to adapt their moves.

## Compatibility

Some parts are only compatible with other types of parts, based on their fuel type.

!!!
**Note** that each ranked season has a finite list of allowed parts, thus making some parts not-usable in that season. This is to keep the game fair and fun.

## Moves

Moves are pre-cast decisions made before the race. Moves are triggered by distance or block count. 

Each build has a limited number of moves.

### Spells

Some parts come with spells that can be triggered as moves. They can also be passive effects that don't require triggering.

They give slight advantages or disadvantages.

## New parts

New parts will be introduced over time, and old parts will stop being sold.
Redline's first season will feature 295 types of parts.

## Breaking parts

Parts can be broken forever with some rare race events like a crash.
