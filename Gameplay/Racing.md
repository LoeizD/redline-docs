A race lasts between 2 to 3 minutes and involves at least 6 competing robots.

!!! Deciding who wins
The results of a race are the combination of robot part selection, moves planning, circuits, weather, other robots in the race as well as a small amount of randomness.
!!!

Races are scheduled in advance with a specific time and circuit location.
Houses must submit their robot builds and moves in advance of the races.


## Randomness and Strategy


Redline is a game of strategy with a dash of randomness. We favor deep thinking over luck.
The two types of randomness that will affect the races are weather data from real world locations and an decentralized verifiable randomness source.

### Race Equation

At regular intervals, the race smart contract determines the position of each contestant on the circuit. This is computed through what is called the Race Equation.
The Race Equation also computes if there was any collision between horses, malfunctions, crashes and other rare events.


### Weather

Weather (temperature and rain) are provided through a decentralized oracle. They are used to give a flavoured randomness to the game, but can be used as part of the strategy by the best players. 

## Circuits

The races take place on circuits. All the circuits are based on real-world locations and use real-world weather. The circuits will provide real-time weather data from the real world to change the race conditions and change the circuit conditions.

Circuits have stats that influence the robots such as ground type and road angle (up/down and left/right).

Circuits are between 10 to 25km in length, racing is usually only 1 lap of the circuit.
