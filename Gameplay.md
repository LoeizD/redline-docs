# Gameplay

Redline races are solved entirely on-chain over a few blocks, and rendered in real time then streamed on twitch. A race lasts around 3 minutes, and is commented by a live caster. Usually races involve 6 racers.

## Seasons

Redline is organized in seasons where players compete for a trophy. Off season races will also be possible later.

### Non-ranked seasons

To play Redline, players must:
1. obtain a free robot by signing up, or pay for a customized robot (buy or rent)
2. sign up for a single race or a competition
3. submit their "moves" ahead of the race
4. Watch and reap the rewards!

### Ranked seasons

Ranked seasons are the official races. They have the biggest prizes. They take place on a set of Tracks all around the world.

To participate in a ranked season, players must first ceate a House and qualify in lesser races.

Ranked seasons allow only a certain list of robot parts and moves for racing, to keep the races high quality and fair.

## Building robots

Robots are made of 8 parts. Each part is an NFT. The first Redline season will feature 295 types of parts, and many more visual customizations. An assembly of 8 parts that form a robot is called a build. Building is done through a web based drag and drop interface.

Robot parts give access to certain moves and have definite stats that interact with the race equation.

Robot builds and moves must be submitted at a fixed time before the race, and every setup is public. The first to submit their robots get a bonus in the race, but others are able to adapt their moves

## Moves

Moves are pre-cast decisions made before the race. Moves are triggered by distance or block count.

## Circuits

The races take place on circuits. All the circuits are based on real-world locations and use real-world weather. The circuits will provide real-time weather data from the real world to change the race conditions and change the circuit conditions.

## Houses

In order to participate in ranked seasons, players must obtain a season token, which grants them access to the ranked races of said season.

Houses can organize themselves as they want, delegating buying, building and racing to different people or voting systems.

Houses are independent from Redline.

Houses can emit and sell official collectibles when participating in a season.

## Randomness and Strategy

Redline is a game of strategy with a dash of randomness. We favor deep thinking over luck.
The two types of randomness that will affect the races are weather data from real world locations and an decentralized verifiable randomness source.

### Race Equation

At regular intervals, the race smart contract determines the position of each contestant on the circuit. This is computed through what is called the Race Equation.
The Race Equation also computes if there was any collision between horses, malfunctions, crashes and other rare events.

### Weather

Weather (temperature and rain) are provided through a decentralized oracle. They are used to give a flavoured randomness to the game, but can be used as part of the strategy by the best players. 


## Play and Earn

The rewards will be adjusted over time. Players can earn **RED** by:
- watching races, rewards in the form of airdrops
- playing non-ranked, with bonuses for winner
- playing raked, with bonuses for winner
- refering other players
- playing with friends
- completing daily challenges

## Mods

Since the race is computed on-chain, any sort of renderer can be designed. One could imagine a race of swimming mermaids based on the Redline race equation. Or use the solution of the race as a part of a more complex game. Renders are just "data visualization" of what happens on-chain.
Having our logic on-chain also allows future collaborations with other on-chain games, like NFT interoperability.
