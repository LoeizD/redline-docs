# Gameplay

Redline races are solved entirely on-chain over a few blocks, and rendered in real time then streamed on twitch. A race lasts around 3 minutes, and is commented by a live caster. Usually races involve 6 racers.

## Base gameplay

To play Redline, players must:
1. obtain a free robot by signing up, or pay for a customized robot (buy or rent)
2. sign up for a single race (non ranked) or a season (ranked)
3. submit their "moves" ahead of the race
4. Watch and reap the rewards!

## Seasons

Redline is organized in seasons where players compete for a trophy.

A basic season is at least 10 races over 5 weeks.


### Ranked seasons

Ranked seasons are the official races. They have the biggest prizes. They take place on a set of at least 10 Circuits all around the world.

To participate in a ranked season, players must first ceate a House and qualify in lesser races.

Ranked seasons allow only a certain list of robot parts and moves for racing, to keep the races high quality and fair.

### Leagues

Leagues are different races organized in each season. They are representative of the level of the participating Houses.
