# Governance

## Governance Token
**RED** is a utility token used in the Redline ecosystem. **RED** is a corresponding governance token.

When you stake **RED**, you receive **xRED**, a token that represents your position in DAO Governance. Because **xRED** is an ERC-20 token, it is transferable to different blockchains and community members.

## Governance Process
Redline governance proposals are submitted on Snapshot. This is where the voting takes place as well. The **xRED** token acts as the governance instrument, enabling the community to vote on new game developments, effectively allocate the treasury finds, and adjust ecosystem parameters in order to manage risk, as well as respond to changing market demands and conditions.

This makes the governance of the platform directly responsive to our most active users and brings Redline closer to being a public good operated by the community members who value it most.

Proposal submission will be reserved for community members having a minimum amount of **xRED**. Proposals pass/fail via simple majority, with a minimum amount of **xRED** voting in favor to reach a quorum.
