# Mods

!!!
Game modding (short for "modification") is the process of alteration by players or fans of one or more aspects of a video game, such as how it looks or behaves. Mods may range from small changes and tweaks to complete overhauls, and can extend the replay value and interest of the game. (source: wikipedia)

## Visual
Since the race is computed on-chain, any sort of renderer can be designed. One could imagine a race of swimming mermaids based on the Redline race equation. Renders are just "data visualization" of what happens on-chain.

## Gameplay

Having our logic on-chain also allows future collaborations with other on-chain games, like NFT interoperability and shared community events.

Wild ideas like using the result of the race as a part of a more complex game.
