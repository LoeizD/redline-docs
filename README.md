## Houses

In order to participate in ranked seasons, players must obtain a season token, which grants them access to the ranked races of said season.

Houses can organize themselves as they want, delegating buying, building and racing to different people or voting systems.

Houses are independent from Redline.

Houses can emit and sell official collectibles when participating in a season.
