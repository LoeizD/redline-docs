## Starknet

StarkNet is a permissionless, decentralized ZK-Rollup on Ethereum. It increases computation speed, lowers cost, and maintains the same security as mainnet.
As players require low latency and cost, StarkNet is a natural environment in which to build games. It allows a range of interactions to be performed on-chain that were previously impossible.


## Unreal Engine

The independent game engine Unreal Engine 5 is used to develop a hyper-realistic visual virtual world. Unreal Engine is an industry leading tool in Games and Cinema, making it simpler for the Redline team to produce and share exciting renders of what happens on-chain.

The races will be streamed to a website, making it super easy for players to watch the races.

Redline will release downloadable clients as well for people who want to watch the races locally.

## WebGL and AR

To make immersion deeper, Redline is creating web-based 3D and AR clients with avatars to play the game and attend races.
