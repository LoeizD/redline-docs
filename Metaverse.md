# Metaverse

We see the metaverse as the connected digital realm.
The metaverse isn't a single product or a place, but the total of digital interconnected places and services. As such, the Redline logic is solved entirely on-chain, allowing interoperability with other games and services.  

Redline is the story surrounding races. We start by creating the race, but our long term plan is to allow players to have a real connection to the Redline universe, and take part in it for generations. Some things that Redline will be developing once the core race is fair and fun to play:
- create immersive game clients to interact with other people through avatars
- create immersive clients to build robots
- more immersion through ownership and expanding the world to more than racing
- connecting to other on-chain games for interoperability
- encourage the community to govern the Redline project
- encourage the community to mod the game
