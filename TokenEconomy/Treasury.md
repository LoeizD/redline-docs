The Redline DAO treasury will serve to organize races on-chain and having a strong treasury is a pillar Redline relies on to have the economic freedom to expand following what the community wants, and not the whim of external market forces.

## Running the race

The races take place over a few block, at which the race smart contract is called. These call will be done trough a decentralized ticker like [Yagi](https://yagi.fi/) that will require some gas.

Here are some other things Redline will spend on:
Emmiting new robot parts.
Paying the data from oracles for randomness or weather.
Paying the gas fees for some user interactions.
Generating new rewards for the community.

## Community Grants

Grants will be awarded to develop or help develop community projects that benefit and strengthen the Redline metaverse. The process will be voted by the Governance.

## Incoming streams:


### Robot parts and customizations
Robot parts are sold by the Redline DAO to houses or individuals.

While basic cosmetic customization of the robot is free, advanced looks for robot parts come for a fee.
### Auctions to display ads in-game
The races are fun to watch and ads will be an important part of the revenue. An auction system will determine which ads are shown on the Redline world, with the help of the Governance to moderate content. 
### Secondary market royalties
When parts are traded on secondary markets, Redline takes a royalty on the trade. The amount will be decided by the Governance.
### Sales of non-gameplay NFT collectibles
These are all the virtual goodies and merch that Redline and the Houses will offer to collect. Royalties also apply.
### Betting
Semi-independent betting smart contracts will be deployed, and a small fee might be router to the treasury, decided by Governance.
### Protocol owned liquidity
Owning our own liquidity, which secures permanance of liquidity for our community. The liquidity fees are also a revenue stream.
### Asset management
Since we have a strong treasury, "safe" asset management becomes possible on top of our protocol.
